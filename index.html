The index.html page is the introductory page to bid18xx and 
contains a welcome message. It should be used to start a new 
hidden bid for 18FL or 18West. And for other games that have
the same kind of hidden bid mechanic.

        <p id="vers">
          This is version x  of BID18xx.
        </p>
        <p>BID18xx is a utility for certain play by email 18xx games.  
          This utility moderates the hidden bids that are used to 
          determine player order in games such as 18FL and 18West.
          It was written to be used with BOARD18 but it should be 
          usable with any Play By Email game system that supports 18xx games.
        </p>
        <p><b>BID18xx uses email to poll the players for their bids.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The next page displays a form in to which the names and
          email addresses of the players should be entered. 
          The order in which the players are entered into this form
          will be used to break ties. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After you have adjusted the number of players, if necessary, 
          please press the "Start the bid setup" button to continue to 
          the next page. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After providing the information on
          the next page, please press "enter". This will cause 
          BID18xx to validate the entries and create a database 
          table entry for this bid session. It will then send an email  
          to each player to request that they enter a bid.
